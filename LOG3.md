Week of Feb 7, 2022 - Feb 13, 2022

Ryan Aultman (Storage-to-Output):
I continued to research how to fix the inverter-motor connection issue, and I am waiting for 
my PCB. Once it comes in, I will solder it.

Thomas Bergeron (Digital Interface):
I have ordered my PCB through the FEDC. The error code screens are up and running, with an Exit 
button to go back to the main screen, and a stop signal to the microcontroller. I left my display 
at home so I will test that on my own time at home.

Janet Park (Controls/Monitoring):
I completed the design for 3D print of the disk to be placed on the motor shaft. I have verified 
that the SCI protocol is supported on the MCU, and have finished implementing the interrupt 
service routine. By the end of this coming week, I will have completed writing the function code, 
and will be able to begin integration with the digital interface subsystem. 

Hunter Ruff (Input-to-Storage):
I have received and soldered my PCB. I’ve also tested all connections between traces, 
ground planes, and solder connections with my multimeter. All these connections have checked 
out and I will be running test benches this week on my PCB to make sure it’s ready to integrate. 
At this point I will be ready to plug in peripherals and load my subsystem.
